             <p class="paragraph">
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is the collection of information, expertise, experience and strategies through which our world is modified,
								  converted and used by humans to create tools, computers, products and services that meet our needs and desires.All the artifacts around us in our daily
									 lives are results of numerous technological advances that have developed over the centuries of our life, we have transformed natural resources to make
									  devices and machines that make our lives easier, fulfill a drive to excellence. There is no doubt that the advances in technology have radically changed our way of thinking, being and living as well as the environment around us.

             <p class="paragraph">
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is making an impact on the environment, individuals and the whole of society. The way people utilize technology
								 defines whether it has positive or negative impacts on society.Innovation is not harmful to society on its own, but the manner in which society uses innovation
								 to achieve specific purposes results in negative impacts of technology on society.We need to use electricity to produce goods in factories, to drive vehicles,
								 to light homes and also to power electronic devices such as computers, but the only way we can do this without impacting the atmosphere and environment is by
								  switching from exhaustible sources of energy to sustainable and inexhaustible sources such as solar and wind energy.

				We're just grown up with tech. We can't deny that we've seen the use of technologies. Every day of our lives is easier to work than they thought. Technology has evolved so
				 much that we can't know how hard life would be.Technology is used in everything from housework to infrastructure development. . We're not waking up until we check at our phone,
				 see online notifications and any news.<br>
				 Some of the main reasons why we use technology are:<br>
                        <br>
                        a) learning and teaching purposes<br>
                        b) Business purposes<br>
                        c) Entertainment<br>
                        d) Future develovement purposes<br>
                        e) Health services<br>
                        f) For Communication<br>
												g) Banking services<br><br>
												And much much more.

				<p class="article_heading">PROS and CONS of Technology</p>
							 <p class="paragraph">
								 
									 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life would be very complicated and behind without technology. Technology has introduced a lot of great things like the opportunity to have
									  illumination by using what we term energy during the night.Technology such as computers laptops and phones make it even easier for people today to share information, make
										better choices, socialize, participate in recreation, efficiently handle financial transactions, shop online, maintain homes as well as other current innovations.
										A very clear innovation benefit is that it saves time. Since we can perform a task in much less time, the time saved could be used for other important activities.The students
										 are expected to become more engaged in the topics they are studying as technology is integrated in to the classes. In terms of teaching that same things in new forms,
										 technology enables numerous opportunities to create learning more interesting and exciting.Technology offers great opportunity to make studying more efficient for anyone with different needs.
										 However, education can provide more opportunities for students with disability or disabilities.Students may learn communication skills by engaging themselves in various online events. Working
										 on various projects, for example, collaborating on forums <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">with others or sharing documents.Technology can help improve other practical skills, including making videos, studying how
										 to distinguish accurately from unreliable Internet sources keeping proper etiquette online and writing emails.


									<br><br>However, just as electricity has brought too much convenience to human life on earth, it has complicated it in some way as well.That more natural gas usage has an overall
									impact on the atmosphere and oceans of the Planet.This is indeed terrible because it demonstrates that the next human age may not consider the planet as healthy as it is now.
									Newer technologies such as phones and computers have a negative environmental impact and the equilibrium of life, even if they are intended to make life worthwhile. When you can
									not afford these technologies, your life will be very backward.Completely dependent on the computers produces poor study patterns.There are many concerns such as computer error and
									connectivity issues that require oodles of time to troubleshoot it, hampering the learning process that can sometimes be a source of annoyance for both the learners and the instructors.
									Several sites come with false information copied and pasted from several other sources without verifying their validity. Thus the learners are misled by incorrect information on the websites.
									 Perhaps these issues can become significant obstacles to their growth.Cheating is an illegal practice but, technology made it more powerful and easier to use. Control of this activity, particularly
									  in the examination area, has actually become very difficult.</span>
